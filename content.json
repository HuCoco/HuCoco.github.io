Typically, there are two question need be deal: What object has been seen? What color of the object is under the influence of light and environment? In nature, a ray will travel to a surface that stop ray traveling, or until out of energy eventually disappears.there are four things might happen with light ray: absorption, reflection, refraction, fluorescence, Ray CastingIn ancient time, it was used for the study of perspective. The first ray tracing algorithm used for rendering was presented by Arthur Appel in 1968.[1] This algorithm has since been termed “ray casting”. The idea behind ray casting is to shoot rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray. Think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel. This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel. Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the shading of this object. The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow. The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models. One important advantage ray casting offered over older scanline algorithms was its ability to easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, such as cones and spheres. If a mathematical surface can be intersected by a ray, it can be rendered using ray casting. Elaborate objects can be created by using solid modeling techniques and easily rendered. Ray Tracingit almost like ray casting, but in ray tracing, it will generate some new ray from the closet intersection point. Reflection ray Refraction ray Shadow rays and this technique also called Recursive Ray Tracing. AdvantagesRay tracing’s popularity stems from its basis in a realistic simulation of lighting over other rendering methods (such as scanline rendering or ray casting). Effects such as reflections and shadows, which are difficult to simulate using other algorithms, are a natural result of the ray tracing algorithm. The computational independence of each ray makes ray tracing amenable to parallelization. DisadvantagesA serious disadvantage of ray tracing is performance (though it can in theory be faster than traditional scanline rendering depending on scene complexity vs. number of pixels on-screen). Scanline algorithms and other algorithms use data coherence to share computations between pixels, while ray tracing normally starts the process anew, treating each eye ray separately. However, this separation offers other advantages, such as the ability to shoot more rays as needed to perform spatial anti-aliasing and improve image quality where needed. Although it does handle interreflection and optical effects such as refraction accurately, traditional ray tracing is also not necessarily photorealistic. True photorealism occurs when the rendering equation is closely approximated or fully implemented. Implementing the rendering equation gives true photorealism, as the equation describes every physical effect of light flow. However, this is usually infeasible given the computing resources required. The realism of all rendering methods can be evaluated as an approximation to the equation. Ray tracing, if it is limited to Whitted’s algorithm, is not necessarily the most realistic. Methods that trace rays, but include additional techniques (photon mapping, path tracing), give far more accurate simulation of real-world lighting. Ray Tracing Detail ShadowAt each surface intersection point,a shadow ray is shot towards eachlight source to determine any occlusion between light source and surface point.

The C is added to the sorting result, then the edge (C, F) and (C, G) are removed; at this time, since F has a dependency on the vertex D, G has a dependency on the vertex A, so it does not handle F and G. A, D is added to the sorting result in turn. After the first step, both A and D are not dependent on the vertex, accessing the A first and then accessing the D according to the storage order. After the access, the edges of the vertex A and the vertex D are deleted. Add E, F, G to the sorting result.

It is usually written as G = (V,E). Types of GraphsAccording to whether the direction of the edge, the graph can be divided into: undirected and directed graph. Undirected graph The above graph is an undirected graph, and all the edges of the undirected graph are not directed. It is written as G0=(V1,{E1}). V1 = { A,B,C,D,E,F } V1 represents a set of vertices composed of A, B, C, D, E, F. E1 = { (A,B),(A,C),(B,C),(B,E),(B,F),(C,F),(C,D),(E,F),(C,E)} E1 is by the edge (A, B), the edge (A, C)… And so on, and so on. (A, C) represents the edge that is connected by the vertex A and the vertex C. Directed graph The graph above is a directed graph. Unlike an undirected graph, all the edges of the directed graph are directed. It is written as G2= (V2, {E2}). V2={ A,C,B,F,D,E,G } V2 represents a set of vertices composed of A, B, C, D, E, F, G. E2={ &lt;A,B&gt;,&lt;B,C&gt;,&lt;B,F&gt;,&lt;B,E&gt;,&lt;C,E&gt;,&lt;E,D&gt;,&lt;D,C&gt;,&lt;E,B&gt;,&lt;F,G&gt; } E2 is a , … And so on, and so on. In this, vector represents the directed edge of the vertex C that is directed by the vertex A. Adjacent &amp; DegreeAdjacentThe two vertices on an edge are called the adjacency points. For example, the vertex A and the vertex C in the above undirected graph are the adjacency points. In the digraph, except for the adjoining points; there are also the notions of &quot;In-Edge&quot; and &quot;Out-Edge&quot;. In-Edge is means which edge that end with the vertex. Out-Edge is means which edge that start with the vertex. For example, the B and E in graph G2 are adjacent points; is the Out-Edge of B, or the In-Edge of E. DegreeIn an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to the vertex. For example, the degree of the vertex A in the above undirected graph is 2. In the digraph, there are also the notions of &quot;In-Degree&quot; and &quot;Out-Degree&quot; In-Degree is means the number of edges at the end of the vertex. Out-Degree is means the number of edges at the start of the vertex. Degree of vertex = In-Degree + Out-Degree Path &amp; CircuitPath: If a vertex sequence exists between the vertex (Vm) to the vertex (Vn). It means that Vm to Vn is a path Length of path: the number of edge in this path. Simple path: If the vertex of a path does not repeat, it is a simple path. Circuit: If the first vertex of the path is the same as the last vertex, it is a Circuit. Simple circuit: If the vertex of a circuit does not repeat, it is a simple circuit. Connected graphs and connected componentsConnected graph: For an undirected graph, there is an undirected path between any two vertices, and the undirected graph is called a connected graph. strongly connected graph: For a directed graph, if there is a directed path between any two vertices in the graph, the directed graph is called a strongly connected graph. Weight of GraphThis is special value in Huffman tree, it is means the value of a edge. Graph Storage StructuresThe storage structure of a graph is commonly used as adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Adjacency MatrixThe adjacency matrix refers to the representation of a graph by a matrix. It uses a matrix to describe the relationship between the vertices of the graph (and the right of the arcs or edges). Two arrays are usually used to implement the graph’s adjacency matrix: a one-dimensional array for storing vertex information and a two-dimensional array for saving edge information. The disadvantage of adjacency matrix is more space-consuming. Assuming that the number of vertices in the graph is n, the adjacency matrix is defined as: A[i][j] = 0 is means that there is no edge. A[i][j] = 1 is means that there are edge. The following undirected graph: The adjacency matrix of this undirected graph is as follows: N/A A B C D E F G A 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 B 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 C 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 D 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 E 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 G 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 The following directed graph: The adjacency matrix of this directed graph is as follows: N/A A B C D E F G A 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 B 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 C 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 D 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 E 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 F 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 G 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Adjacency ListThe adjacency list is a chain storage representation method of a graph. It is an improved “adjacency matrix”, its disadvantage is that it is inconvenient to judge whether there is an edge between the two vertices, but it is less space relative to the adjacency matrix. The following undirected graph: The adjacency list of this undirected graph is as follows: The following directed graph: The adjacency list of this directed graph is as follows:","categories":[{"name":"Data Structure","slug":"Data-Structure","permalink":"http://HuCoco.com/categories/Data-Structure/"},{"name":"Graph","slug":"Data-Structure/Graph","permalink":"http://HuCoco.com/categories/Data-Structure/Graph/"}],"tags":[{"name":"C++","slug":"C","permalink":"http://HuCoco.com/tags/C/"},{"name":"Data Structure","slug":"Data-Structure","permalink":"http://HuCoco.com/tags/Data-Structure/"},{"name":"Graph","slug":"Graph","permalink":"http://HuCoco.com/tags/Graph/"}]},{"title":"RedBlackTree_III","slug":"RedBlackTree-III","date":"2018-03-02T15:38:19.000Z","updated":"2018-03-05T14:00:03.085Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/03/02/RedBlackTree-III/","link":"","permalink":"http://HuCoco.com/2018/03/02/RedBlackTree-III/","excerpt":"RedBlackTree III Chinese version address The Last Section Basic operation of red black treesDeleteThe method of deleting a node is the same as that of deleting a node in a binary search tree.

If you delete the red node, then the feature of red black tree remains. At this time do not do the correction operation. If the deleted node is a black node, the feature of the red black tree may be changed, and we want to make corrections to it So what are the feature of trees that will change? If the delete node is not the only node in the tree, then the number of black nodes to each leaf node of the delete node will change, and the property 5 is destroyed. If the deleted node’s only non-empty child node is red, and the deleted node’s parent node is also red, then the feature of 4 is destroyed. If the deleted node is the root node and its only non-empty child node is red, the new root node will be red after deletion, violating property 2. The above repair looks a bit complicated, here we use an analytical skills: begin to adjust the node from which the node was removed later, And think it has an extra black color. What is the meaning of an extra black here? We do not add the nodes of the red and black trees to another color of red and black. Here is just an assumption, and we think we are currently pointing to it, so there is an extra black. It can be thought that its black color is inherited from its parent after it was deleted. It can now hold two colors. If it was originally red, then it is red + black, and if it is black then its current color It is black + black. With this extra black, the feature of red-black tree 5 will remain unchanged. Now it is enough to resume other things as far as possible, and try to move all the possibilities to the root as far as possible. If it is the case, the recovery is relatively simple: The current node is red + black.The current node is set to black, the end of the red-black tree at this time the nature of all recovery.

Set this node to red. Modify the tree by rotating and recoloring it to make it a red-black tree again. Step DescriptionStep 1The red-black tree is a binary search tree, which is still a binary search tree after the node is inserted. This means that the key of the tree is still ordered. In addition, whether it is left-rotation or right-rotation, the tree is a binary search tree before rotation, and after rotation it must be a binary search tree. Step 2Why should set the node’s color to red? Because it is not violate 5 features. violate more less feature mean less things we need to deal with. Step 3So how many features it violate? As for feature 1, obviously not violate. As for feature 2, insert operation does not change the root node, so the color of root node is still black. As for feature 3, leaf node is null node, inserting non-null node does not affect feature. As for feature 4, Is possible to violate. Case DescriptionCase 1DescriptionThe current node’s parent node is red, and the current node’s grandparent node’s other child node (uncle node) is also red 1234while color[p[z]] = RED do if p[z] = left[p[p[z]]] then y ← right[p[p[z]]] if color[y] = RED Grandfather node must exist at this time, otherwise it is not black red tree before inserting. At this point is divided into the parent node is the grandfather’s left child or right child, according to symmetry, we just untie a direction on it. Here only consider the parent node left grandfather’s situation, as shown below. MethodStrategy is as follows: Sets the parent node to black. Sets the node of the uncle to black. set grandfather node to red. The grandfather node is set as the current node (red node).

Red Black Tree Features the color of each node is red or black. the color of root node is black. the color of each leaf node is black. if a node is red, the subnode of it must be black. The same number of black nodes is included on all paths from a node to the node’s descendant node. Notes: leaf node is means which node is null. Feature 5 to ensure that no path is twice as long as the other path. Thus, the red black tree is a relatively balanced binary tree. Application of red black treesThe application of the red-black tree is particularly extensive, mainly because it uses it to store ordered data. Its time complexity is O (lgn), which is very efficient. But its implementation is complicated, and insert, delete operation will pay more cost.
